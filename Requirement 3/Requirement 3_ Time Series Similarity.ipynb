Here's what the code does step by step:\n","\n","1.  Initialize variables: The first two lines of the function extract the number of rows (i.e. the length) of the input arrays s and t, and assign the values to variables n and m. Then, a two-dimensional array DTW of size (n+1, m+1) is created, filled with the value np.inf (i.e. positive infinity).\n","\n","2.  Set the starting point: The value at the first cell of the DTW array, DTW[0, 0], is set to 0. This represents the starting point of the DTW calculation.\n","\n","3. Loop through arrays: The next two nested for-loops are used to iterate through the arrays s and t. The outer loop i goes from 1 to n+1 (inclusive), and the inner loop j goes from 1 to m+1 (inclusive).\n","\n","4.  Calculate cost: At each iteration of the inner loop, the cost variable is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the current elements of s and t, i.e. np.linalg.norm(s[i-1]-t[j-1]). This represents the cost of matching the two elements.\n","\n","5.  Update DTW array: The value of DTW[i, j] is then updated as the minimum of the values at the three cells above it: DTW[i-1, j], DTW[i, j-1], and DTW[i-1, j-1], plus the cost calculated in step 4. This implements the core dynamic programming step of DTW.\n","\n","6.  Return result: Finally, the function returns the value at the last cell of the DTW array, DTW[n, m], which represents the DTW distance between the two input arrays."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1676205792717,"user":{"displayName":"Γεώργιος
